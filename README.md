# 🌍 Global Air Quality and Pollution Trends  
*A Data Mining Project using Global Air Pollution Datasets*

## 📌 Project Overview  
Air pollution is one of the most critical global public health challenges.  
This project explores how air quality varies across regions, time, climate, and socioeconomic conditions.  
Using multiple datasets, we perform extensive data mining and exploratory analysis to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and insights.

The primary goal is to understand pollution behavior, identify high-risk regions, and analyze factors influencing air quality worldwide. This includes answering key exploratory questions through data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## 📂 Datasets Used  

### **1. Global Air Pollution Data**
- Measurements of pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3**
- Covers thousands of cities across multiple countries

### **2. World Bank – Air Quality & Socioeconomic Indicators**
- PM2.5 exposure data
- GDP per capita  
- Urban population %, population density  
- Public health indicators

### **3. US EPA PM2.5 Monitoring Data**
- Hourly and daily PM2.5 readings from U.S. EPA monitoring stations
- Includes state, county, latitude, longitude, and monitoring site metadata
- Contains pollutant details, monitoring methods, and AQI values

### **4. PM2.5 Exposure – World Bank Dataset**
- Country-level PM2.5 exposure data
- Annual values for each country
- Measured as population-weighted average concentration (µg/m³)

We merge datasets where necessary to explore relationships between pollution, geography, health, and economic development.

## ❓ Exploratory Questions  

Our analysis focuses on answering:

1. **Which countries/cities have the highest and lowest average pollution levels?**
2. **How do pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3) correlate?**
3. **What is the relationship between GDP per capita and pollution levels?**
4. **Do seasonal variations exist (e.g., winter spikes, summer dips)?**
5. **How has air quality changed globally and regionally over the last 20 years?**
6. **How volatile is AQI across different locations?**

# Global Air Quality and Pollution Trends  
*A Data Mining Project using Global Air Pollution Dataset*

## Project Overview  
Air pollution is one of the most critical global public health challenges. This project explores how air quality varies across regions, time, climate, and socioeconomic conditions. Using data from several resources, we perform extensive data mining and exploratory analysis to uncover hidden trends, correlations, and insights about global air quality.

Our goal is to understand pollution patterns, identify high-risk regions, and analyze the factors influencing air quality across the world. This project aims to **analyze global air quality patterns** and answer key exploratory questions by mining and visualizing large datasets.

## 📂 Datasets Used  

### **1. Global Air Pollution Data**  
- Contains measurements of pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3**  
- Covers thousands of cities across multiple countries

### **2. World Bank – Air Quality & Socioeconomic Indicators**  
- PM2.5 exposure data  
- GDP per capita  
- Urban population (%), population density  
- Health indicators

### **3. US EPA PM2.5 Monitoring Data**  
- Contains hourly PM2.5 measurements from U.S. EPA air quality monitoring stations.
- Includes detailed location and site metadata such as state, county, latitude, longitude, and local site name.
- Provides pollutant information, monitoring method details, and associated air quality indicators (e.g., AQI).

### **4. PM25- Exposure-Worldbank Dataset**  
- Contains country-level PM2.5 exposure data from the World Bank
- Includes annual values for each country
- PM2.5 exposure measured as population-weighted average concentration (µg/m³)
  
We merge these datasets according to the necessity, to explore relationships between pollution, geography, and development.

## Exploratory Questions  
Our analysis focuses on answering the following core data mining questions:

1. **Which countries/cities have the highest and lowest average pollution levels?**
2. **How do different pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3) correlate with each other?**
3. **What is the relationship between GDP per capita and air pollution levels?**
4. **Are there seasonal pollution variations (e.g., winter spikes, summer dips)?** 
5. **How has air quality changed globally and regionally over the last 20 years?**
6. **Volatility Analysis of AQI**
